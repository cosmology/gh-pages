We’ll favor fading strength while below the weekly open at 1.3575 with a break below 1.3456 shifting the focus towards confluence support at the median-line / 38.2% retracement at 1.3389.\n\nA breach of the objective weekly opening-range highs / 1.3589 would keep the broader long-bias in play with such a scenario targeting subsequent resistance objectives at the 2017 high at 1.3658 and the Brexit gap at 1.3675. Bottom line: the risk is lower in sterling but ultimately a larger setback would offer more favorable long-entries while within the broader uptrend. Look for a break / close of the monthly opening-range to get things going.",
